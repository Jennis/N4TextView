# N4TextView 

**(on going project)**

Another replacement for UITextView with support for NSAttributedString.

**Aim of N4TextView (read: Why I made this?)**

Because all other UITextView-like implementations don't fully support multi stage input languages like Japanese, etc.
N4TextView does!. Furthermore, I plan to improve it to support right-to-left languages like Arabian, etc.

This implementation is based on two projects:

- [iPhone-OS-RichtTextKit][1]: Written by [iamamused][2]
- BYTextInputTest : A sample an Apple Engineer kindly brought me long time ago :)
