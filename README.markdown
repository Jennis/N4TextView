# N4TextView 

**(on going project)**

Another replacement for UITextView with support for NSAttributedString.

**Why I make this?**

Because all other UITextView-like implementations don't fully support multi stage input languages like Japanese, etc.
N4TextView does!. Furthermore, I plan to improve it to support right-to-left languages like Arabian, etc.

This implementation is based on two *just a little bit old* projects:

- [iPhone-OS-RichtTextKit][1]: Written by [iamamused][2]
- BYTextInputTest : A sample an Apple Engineer kindly brought me long time ago :)

**Milestones:**

2011/08/01 : Alpha1 : Input is fine but several UI fixes are needed
